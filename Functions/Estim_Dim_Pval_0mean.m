function [ vDimSel, mEigFunc_dec, mLoadings ] = Estim_Dim_Pval_0mean( Xdec, p, Nboot, alpha, d0)
% 
% Description
% 
% in this function we estimate the dimension of curves time series using the
% method of Fonseca and Pinheiro (2019). If some dimension d0 is provided,
% the function just computes wavelet cofficients of eigenfunctions and
% corresponding loadings. The functions must already have ZERO MEAN.
% 
% Inputs
% Xdec  - matrix of wavelet coefficients of the curves, which should have
%       zero mean
% p     - lag used to perform the dimension estimation
% Nboot - number of bootstrap replications used in the eigenvalue
%       resampling
% alpha - significance level used in the bootstrap test of eigenvalues
% d0    - if not passaded through arguments, the function estimates the
%       process dimension, otherwise, it just uses the value d0 passed in it
% 
% Outputs
% vDimSel       - the estimated dimension (equal to d0 when it is passed)
% mEigFunc_dec  - matrix with wavelet coefficients of the estimated eigenfunctions
% mLoadings     - matrix of loadings related to eigenfunctions

[~, n] = size(Xdec);

% matrix with the deviations of the coefficients with respect to the mean
% coefficients in a same day
C = Xdec;

% now we obtain a matrix composed of the coefficients from the decomposition
% of the observed fuctional
C1 = C(:,1:(n-p));
D1 = zeros(n-p,n-p);
for k=1:p
    D1 = D1 + C(:,(k+1):(n-p+k))'*C(:,(k+1):(n-p+k));
end
D = C1*D1*C1'/((n-p)^2);

% after computing D, we obtain its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The
% columns of B have the eigenvectors of D, which are wavelet coefficients
% of the eigenfunctions corresponding to eigenvalues in the diagonal of L
[B,L] = eig(D);
% reordering the eigenvectors in decreasing order corresponding to the
% eigenvalues
[L,vI] = sort(diag(L),'descend');
B = B(:, vI);
L = diag(L);

% checking if the variable d0 is passad through in the arguments. If it is
% the case, we use the passed value as dimension estimate, otherwise, it'll
% be estimated
if ~exist('d0','var')
    % performing a bootstrap test to estimate the process' dimension
    d0 = 1;
    % if the estimated dimension is greater than 8, vDimSel will be
    % fixed at 9
    vDimSel = 9;
    mPvalues = ones(1,8);  % p-values of the tests for the largest 8 eigenvalues

    while d0<=8
        % we simulate a process of dimension d0 and then obtain an empirical
        % bootstrap distribution of the (d0+1)-th largest eigenvalue of D using
        % the function DimEst_wavestrap
        d_boot = DimEst_wavestrap( Xdec, Nboot, B(:,[1:d0]), p);
        % p-value for the (d0+1)-th largest eigenvalue of D
        mPvalues(1,d0) = sum(d_boot>L(d0+1,d0+1))/Nboot;
        % we verify now if the null hypothesis that this eigenvalue is zero is
        % rejected or not
        if (mPvalues(1,d0)>alpha)
            % if the null hypothesis is not rejected for d0+1, then the
            % selected dimension is d0
            vDimSel = d0;
            d0 = 9;
        end
        d0 = d0 + 1;
    end
else
    vDimSel = d0;
end

% matrix with wavelet coefficients of the estimated eigenfunctions
mEigFunc_dec = B(:,1:vDimSel);
% matrix of loadings related to eigenfunctions
mLoadings = C'*B(:,1:vDimSel);
